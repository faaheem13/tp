## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/studentId/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/studentId/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/studentId/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/studentId/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/studentId/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

1. For commands that have no arguments, instead of creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `ListCommandParser`), the `Command` object(e.g. ListCommand) is simply returned by the `AddressBookParser` .

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.

* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/studentId/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,
 
* stores the ClassBook data i.e., all `Classes` objects. (Each `Classes` object has its own AddressBook).
* stores the currently selected `Classes` instance, and its corresponding `AddressBook`.
* stores all `Person` objects in the `AddressBook` of the  currently selected `Classes` instance (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/studentId/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save addressBook data, classBook data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `ClassBookStorage`, `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated one of the above. (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The below activity diagram illustrates the process of deleting an attendance record.

<puml src="diagrams/CheckIfDateExistsForDeleteAttendanceRecordCommand.puml" />


# Implementation of Classes feature
The Classes feature is built using the basic structure of `AddressBook`. `Classes` represents a tutorial class.
### 1. Basic structure
A `ClassBook` instance holds all current `Classes` instances. This is stored in the data folder as `classbook.json`
file. <br />
Each `Classes` instance contains an instance of `Addressbook`, which holds a list of `Person` instances
representing the students in the Class. Each `Classes` instance stored in data as `[className].json` where
className is the name of the `Classes` instance e.g. `CS2103.json`

### 2. Changes to Storage
Problem 1:
The original structure of AB3 only allows for a single file path for storage, which was set to `addressbook.json`
by default. This was a big problem, as our intended implementation of the Classes feature necessitated
multiple .json files to make sharing data between tutors easier. <br />

Solution 1 v1.0:
Rather than use the filepath specified in the `preferences.json`, `ModelManager` was changed to use
its own instance of `Storage`, to call the `saveAddressBook` with `selectedClass.getFilePath()`
as the second parameter. This works, but SLAP is not ideal with the current implementation.

### 3. Changes to UI
Problem 1:
Since the original AB3 had only one command (find) that required the UI to be updated, the UI was implemented to update
based on the contents of the `filteredPersonsList`. This was inadequate for our classes feature, which
requires the UI's `PersonListPanel` to be updated upon selecting a different class.

Solution 1:
A list of `UiUpdateListener` - `List<UiUpdateListener> uiUpdateListeners` is created in ModelManager by calling
`modelManager.addUiUpdateListener(uiManager);` in MainApp. The listeners monitors for calls to the `select` command,
and call `mainWindow.fillInnerParts()` to update the UI PersonListPanel.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* NUS Teaching Assistants (TAs) who has to keep track of students' profile and attendance record during class.
* Has a need to manage a significant number of contacts, including potentially different classes.
* Manages student's profile such as contact information, attendance, etc.
* Prefer desktop apps over other types.
* Able to type fast.
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions.
* Is reasonably comfortable using Command Line Interface (CLI) applications.

**Value proposition**: Makes tutors life easier by increasing convenience of checking progress and compacting all the relevant information for easy access (Student contact information, attendance records, summary of attendance statuses, etc.)

       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Viewing the classes
1. Viewing the classes
   1. Prerequisites: Nil
  
   1. Test case: `view` (at least one class)<br>
      Expected: Classes are displayed in the UI, each labelled with an index number(e.g. "1:CS2103  2:CS2101")
   1. Test case: `view` (no classes)<br>
      Expected: Interface displays a message stating you are not managing any classes, and prompts to `create` a class
   1. Test case: `view randominput1234567`<br>
      Expected: Identical behaviour to `view`, Classes are displayed in the UI, each labelled with an index number(e.g. "1:CS2103  2:CS2101")
### Selecting a class
1. Selecting a class
   1. Prerequisites: At least one class must have been created. You may use `view` to see all current classes (Note: It is not compulsory to use `view`, as long as you know the index, you can `select` your desired class)

   1. Test case: `select 0`<br>
      Expected: No class is selected. Error details shown in the status message.
   1. Test case: `select 1` (At least one class exists)<br>
      Expected: The first class by index is selected. The filepath of the class' .json file will be shown on the bottom left corner/
   1. Test case: `select 10` (There are less than 10 classes)<br>
      Expected: No class is selected. Error details shown in the status message.

### Removing a class
1. Removing a class
   1. Prerequisites: At least one class must have been created. You may use `view` to see all current classes (Note: It is not compulsory to use `view`, as long as you know the index, you can `rm` your desired class)

   1. Test case: `rm 0`<br>
      Expected: No class is removed. Error details shown in the status message. The current filepath (in the bottom left corner) is not changed
   1. Test case: `rm 1` (At least one class exists)<br>
      Expected: The first class by index is selected. The current filepath (in the bottom left corner) will be changed to `.\No class selected!`. (Note: Even if another class is selected, when any class is deleted, the .json file will be closed and the filepath will be displayed as `.\No class selected!`.)

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: At least one person shown in the interface. You may `select` a class, `find` a person, `add` a person or use `list` to see all persons in a class (note: `list` is automatically called when you `select` a class, so if the selected class has at least one person in it, they will show up in the interface).
   

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. 

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
      
   1. Test case: `delete 1` (no class selected)<br>
      Expected: Interface prompts you to `select` a class first

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.


### Adding a description

1. Adding a description while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: At least one person shown in the interface. You may `select` a class, `find` a person, `add` a person or use `list` to see all persons in a class (note: `list` is automatically called when you `select` a class, so if the selected class has at least one person in it, they will show up in the interface).

   1. Test case: `description 1 desc/Hello`<br>
      Expected: First student/contact has a description added to them. Details of where the description has been added is shown.

   1. Test case: `description 0 desc/Hello`<br>
      Expected: Error message thrown. No description is added to any contact.

   1. Other incorrect description commands: `description 1 Hello`, `description`, `description desc/Hello`, `description x desc/Hello` (Where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Error message thrown. No description is added to any contact.

   1. Adding a description works in concurrence with add/edit commands as well. As long as their prerequisites are met, and description is following a prefix `desc/`, it should work effectively.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. A missing data file of a StudentBook may occur if user accidentally deletes the `.json` file of the class. <br>
      A corrupted data file may occur if user accidentally edits the `.json` files manually and inputs invalid data.<br>
      Expected: All data from that missing/corrupted file is wiped. A new `classbook.json` or new `[class].json` will be created when program runs again.
