### Project: MustVas

MustVas is a desktop app designed to help fellow Teaching Assistants (TAs) manage tutorial contacts. Its key features include **creating and selecting classes, adding students' contacts, and tracking their attendance**. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MustVas can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

1. Set up team github, CI and MarkBind.
2. Add new functions for recording attendance records 
- add attendannce records
- edit attendance records 
- delete attendance records.
3. Update the exisiting addCommand and editCommand to accommodate new fields. 
4. Update Person.java with new fields.
4. Change the format of the Json based on the required fields. 
5. Updated User Guide and Developer Guide to match our MustVas's context.
- Design some sequence diagrams for add, edit, adda, edita, dela commands.  
- Design some activity diagrams for select, create, adda, edit, adda, edita, dela commands.
